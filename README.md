# Outlines

This repository serves as container to collect initial ideas and project targets.  This readme serves as a general draft document.

## Goal
- To create and maintain a global community around collective meditation moments, where people can join an organized meditation across the world. 
- To have at least 2 moments per day to compensate the timezone differences. 
- To have a variety of meditation topics provided by the great spiritual leaders and the community, inspired by the current date and events.


## Motivation 
Collective meditation has a remarkable impact on the environment of the participants and beyond.  More and more studies show the positive effects of doing collective meditations


## Projects
- Mobile app
- Web platform 
- Social Media app

## Todo
This project is still in it's earliest form, everything still has to begin.  I do believe the idea is strong enough to give it enough momentum to reach a global community and be able to improve the lives of millions. Please do feel free to pro-actively get in touch if this resonates..
