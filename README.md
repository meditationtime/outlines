# Outlines

This repository serves as container to collect initial ideas and project targets.  This readme serves as a general draft document. 

## Goal
- To create and maintain a global community around collective meditation moments, allowing people to join an organized meditation across the world together. 
- To have at least 2 meditation times per day to compensate the timezone differences. 
- To have a variety of meditation topics provided by the great spiritual leaders and the community, inspired by the current date and events.


## Motivation 
Collective meditation has a remarkable impact on the environment of the participants and beyond.   More and more studies show the positive effects of participating in collective meditations


## Projects
- Mobile app
- Web platform

## Todo
This project is still in it's earliest form, everything still has to begin.  I do believe the idea is strong enough to give it enough momentum to reach a global community and be able to improve the lives of millions.  Please do feel free to pro-actively get in touch if this resonates..

## github 101
If you don't know github (you're looking at it), it's a free online content repository where people can collaborate both in simple and very advanced ways, powering thousands of interesting projects. Anyone can contribute and all changes are reversible (the very nature of version control).
