{"name":"Outlines","tagline":"General idea container","body":"# Outlines\r\n\r\nThis repository serves as container to collect initial ideas and project targets.  This readme serves as a general draft document and is still very incomplete. \r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n- To create and maintain a global community around collective meditation moments, allowing people to join an organized meditation across the world together. \r\n- To have at least 2 meditation times per day to compensate the timezone differences. \r\n- To have a variety of meditation topics provided by the great spiritual leaders and the community, inspired by the current date and events.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation \r\nCollective meditation has a remarkable impact on the environment of the participants and beyond.   More and more studies show the positive effects of participating in collective meditations.  Allowing local communities to share their topics and interests while gaining more attendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n- [Mobile app](https://github.com/meditationtime/app)\r\n- Web platform \r\n- Social Media apps\r\n- Campaign\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\nThis project is still in its earliest form, everything still has to begin.  I do believe the idea is strong enough to give it the momentum to reach a global community and be able to improve the lives of millions.  Please do feel free to get in touch if this resonates..\r\n\r\n## github 101\r\nIf you don't know github (you're looking at it), it's a free online content repository where people can collaborate both in simple and very advanced ways, powering thousands of interesting projects.
